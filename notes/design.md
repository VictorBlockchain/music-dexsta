Create a UI component with a playful, Pixar-inspired aesthetic using the following design guidelines:

COLOR PALETTE:
- Background: Gradient from indigo-900 via purple-900 to pink-800
- Primary accents: Purple-500, pink-500, and amber-400 for highlights
- Text: White for headings, purple-900 for labels, purple-600/80 for descriptions
- Interactive elements: Gradient from purple-500 to pink-500

CARD DESIGN:
- Use white/semi-transparent cards (bg-white/90) with backdrop blur
- Apply rounded-3xl corners and soft shadows (shadow-2xl)
- Remove borders (border-0)

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
- Buttons: Gradient background (purple-500 to pink-500), rounded-2xl, with hover effects (scale to 1.02 and shadow change)
- Inputs: Rounded-2xl, purple-50/80 background, purple-200/50 border, purple-400 focus ring
- Tabs: Rounded-2xl with purple-100/50 background, active state has gradient and scale effect

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headings: Bold, with gradient text effect (purple-400 via pink-400 to amber-300)
- Labels: Purple-800, font-semibold
- Descriptions: Purple-600/80

DECORATIVE ELEMENTS:
- Include static music notes in low opacity (purple-300/30, pink-300/30, amber-300/30) positioned around components
- No background animations - keep decorative elements static

LOGO/ICON TREATMENT:
- White card with icon, surrounded by gradient blur
- Interactive hover effects (scale and rotate)

OVERALL VIBE:
- Playful, friendly, and inviting
- Clean and minimal without busy animations
- Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Maintain consistent rounded corners throughout (3xl for cards, 2xl for inputs/buttons)
- Use backdrop-blur-xl for transparency effects

The component should feel cohesive with the music review platform theme, using vibrant colors associated with music tones while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic.
